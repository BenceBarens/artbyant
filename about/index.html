            <h1>Antoni van de Geijn</h1>
            <p>Antoni van de Geijn is a 19-year-old visionary artist and emerging creative force based just outside Amsterdam. His work transcends traditional painting and becomes an act of worldbuilding through art.</p>
            <p>At the heart of Antoni's practice is The Visual Universe, a term he coined to describe his cinematic, interconnected body of work. Rather than portraying the real world in a realistic manner, Antoni turns inward. He paints imagined worlds in an abstract way, using art to explore emotional depth and untold stories. Each canvas serves as a scene from an ever-expanding imagined reality, inviting viewers into a universe that grows with every piece.</p>
            <p>Within this universe, characters are introduced through their own individual paintings. Much like in a cinematic universe, these figures reappear across different works, crossing over and interacting during key moments and shared events within a canonical timeline. This continuity creates a layered, unfolding narrative that deepens the sense of immersion and connection between each painting.</p>
            <p>These worlds are never static. They evolve organically, forming a continuous visual narrative that extends far beyond any single artwork. Antoni does not aim to replicate what is already visible. Instead, he gives shape to the invisible, expressing internal landscapes of emotion, memory, and imagination through color, form, and texture.</p>
            <p>A self-taught artist, Antoni works with unconventional tools such as protractors, cardboard, and spatulas to create richly textured and tactile surfaces. His works blend abstraction with storytelling, forming poetic visual experiences that invite viewers to discover personal meaning within The Visual Universe.</p>
            <p>His creative voice is further shaped by a passion for filmmaking and poetry. These disciplines influence how he composes, paces, and layers meaning in his work. His painter's eye brings cinematic structure to each piece, while his poetic sensibility infuses them with emotional and conceptual depth.</p>
            <p>Through Art by Ant, Antoni has built a multidisciplinary space where painting, film, and poetry come together. It is a space where contemporary creativity merges with the power of storytelling.</p>
            <p>Step into The Visual Universe and explore the evolving imagined worlds of Antoni van de Geijn, an artist trying to forge new paths in modern art.</p>

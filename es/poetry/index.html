                <summary>Chiquitito (for Aly)</summary>
                <p>I miss the things I can't explain,<br>like 'chiquitito'<br>in the way you'd say.<br>And I know how to make <br>me go insane<br>by looking for tickets on the cheapest plane,<br>skipping the better seats for those to LA,<br>or folding sentences of genuine pain,<br>thinking of how to send envelopes <br>with dried flowers and long letters<br>across the ocean, all the way from Spain.</p>
                <p>I guess it will be my bane,<br>viewing that picture of you by the coast.<br>Livid, for those things are my only hope to cope.<br>They are my rope of lasting efforts and active love,<br>but not strong enough <br>to tie a knot around what I can't explain.<br>Like watching cities from above, <br>or wiping tears in the pouring rain. <br>Like the scent of your sweater<br>wearing off too fast. <br>Not to be replicated, eternally awaited, <br>a guilty pleasure, <br>not to be bottled up or built to last.<br>And It makes me stay up past<br>my bedtime <br>to finish your poem.</p>
                <p>So, please call me 'chiquitito' every so often<br>and let me enjoy the unknown.<br>Because, for a moment, it makes my heart soften<br>and forget that I'm grown.</p>

                <summary>Imagine (for Aly)</summary>
                <p>Imagine if<br>we went to Oxford on an autumn day.<br>Imagine studying history, while the orange leaves curl away.<br>Imagine opening your umbrella to go and see<br>if we should get a coffee<br>on the corner of the street.<br>Imagine if I wore glasses,<br>or made jokes about certain things.<br>Imagine being birds, imagine having wings.<br>Imagine thinking about every moment, every night.<br>Imagine playing the violin, <br>imagine speaking music, unable to write.<br>Imagine the instant where two sides<br>of a coin meet.<br>Imagine the difference making a difference for once.<br>Imagine logic flying out the window, slammed open to release<br>your bedridden dove, who'd been plotting to flee.<br>Imagine you and me, split between a distance<br>and the meaning of love.<br>For we're not made for our eyes, or made to be judged.<br>And we are not made to disguise <br>our souls in apparel, <br>because to love,<br>to love means to rise to the bottom of the barrel,<br>it means to scrape truths from the depths of the heart.<br>So, imagine loving somebody<br>whose touch appreciates with every month apart.</p>
                <p>Imagine now, loving in a hurry,<br>running lips before the clock ticks and the engines roar.<br>Imagine how frustrating, to figure out unpractical romance,<br>without the ability to drive door to door.<br>Imagine how aimless it can feel, when life's a chore.<br>But imagine me, believing in a chance, to the core.<br>Imagine giving your gut the wheel, to take a breath, <br>and imagine that one day we'll be together, for real,<br>with an empty tank and nothing left.</p>

                <summary>When we Move, Where do we Go?</summary>
                <p>When we move, where do we go?<br>Or more like,<br>what do I do, when I don't know?<br>Will I grow and undergo,<br>or give it all away,<br>for a quick change back-stage,<br>swapping half my dreams for pay?</p>
                <p>It might start any day,<br>for you are see-through,<br>you who <br>wants to know the city by heart<br>like a divorced spouse, all knowing,<br>yet growing apart.<br>Like an unwanted stranger invited to one's house.<br>There to sell art by touch, without fingers<br>and with the lights out.</p>
                <p>And you might see,<br>why people trust the things they doubt.<br>Why they burn maps with little flames,<br>instead of changing their routes.<br>Why they don't say hi on the street,<br>why they shake hands by name<br>to make interactions complete.<br>So, I will try to do a good deed<br>for a city that doesn't give a damn about me,<br>and after, I'll pull myself under the rug, down below.<br>So city, if you know who I am, then tell me, <br>when we move, where do we go?</p>

                <summary>Watch the Wing (For Aly)</summary>
                <p>Watch the wing<br>and leave behind a dozen or more<br>memories to weep to,<br>memories to tell,<br>to scream<br>into clenched pillows, <br>rolling on the wooden floor.<br>And, watch the wing to see <br>where your love was stored,<br>where your key was thrown,<br>where we missed each other<br>before missing the sea.<br>Where you sat next to me on the Barcelona beach,<br>discussing airplane movies, the strong UV<br>and the flight back home,<br>so soft spoken, scored by foam, and asking<br>if I could please, please, please, scratch your knee.</p>
                <p>And I know, you wish to never be alone,<br>for you hate what you see<br>when you watch the wing.<br>I know you forget to smile<br>about all it brings, and the things<br>you have to leave behind<br>in countries that keep our young hearts confined.<br>Countries where you have to love yourself, before I do,<br>and buckle to pull through a period outlined<br>by phone calls that sting and stir your absent mind.<br>I know we live without, to love within,<br>I know how lucky we are, I know what time is like,<br>and I know what it means<br>to cry and watch the wing</p>

                <summary>Sea Sheets (for Aly)</summary>
                <p>Another night, hovering under the sheets of the sea,<br>in fetal position,<br>to warm my missing bones.<br>Another night to wash my aching body,<br>tucked in and awakened<br>by the ebb and flow.<br>Another night, where my back gets carved and rounded<br>by the polished stones,<br>by our hand-picked pebbles<br>that we used to throw.</p>
                <p>And these sea sheets know<br>what has left.<br>Why I want to sleep in embrace, <br>why I want to feel at ease,<br>in a world of silence and stress.<br>They know why I whisper <br>when I say that I prefer my waters gray.<br>They know why I opt to be alone,<br>in almost any case.<br>Or why I chase the gaze of a more loving sea,<br>why I dream to lift my head<br>above these wailing sheets.</p>
                <p>So, tonight is another night where they'll do their best<br>to love me without a heartbeat<br>or rhythm to their flesh and breath.<br>These sea sheets will try to replicate<br>the way you sleep<br>and the way I rest.</p>

                <summary>This Is Us (for Aly)</summary>
                <p>Give me a figure of how far grief digs in your heart<br>and I'll tell you that this is us.<br>Us, as in, speaking the language of touch,<br>while pulling through crowds.<br>As in, stumbling Dutch<br>reading my homework out loud.<br>This is us, as in,<br>a cup of warm rice<br>to make your belly sound,<br>or giving me your last slice,<br>calling things our secret place,<br>or accurately guessing the taxi price<br>and luggage weight by the pound.<br>Like throwing tiny rocks on random people<br>and grinning in unison while the waves break.<br>This is us, as in, nightly scratches on your skin,<br>and hot countries with high prices, for no reason at all.<br>Us, as in, forgetting to be thin, <br>or falling from the stairs,<br>that didn't seem so steep.<br>Like combing your wet hair<br>and having no issue falling asleep.<br>This is us,<br>or what we are supposed to be.<br>Hating airports and getting bit up on the beach,<br>for we know the worst of goodbyes,<br>and the best of both worlds.<br>We know why we hurt for love,<br>and cut like a double edged sword.<br>We know why we cry and why we cuss.<br>We know, because in the end, this is us.</p>

                <p>Paint me a portrait of the you within.<br>The things that shiver<br>along your olive skin.<br>Or,<br>whisper all the things<br>that make you tick and<br>scream away<br>the fragile void<br>that came to play<br>with your beating heart.</p>
                <p>She, who had a running start,<br>yet, along the way<br>fell apart.<br>He, who would rather stay<br>in the cupboard<br>then lay<br>with a mouth full of dust.</p>
                <p>Those, who refuse to speak out or speak up<br>the promises once uttered.<br>Those that meddled in their stomach,<br>too mad to declutter<br>some painful hope.</p>
                <p>Me, or us for that fact,<br>welding back the chain,<br>because somehow we are a little sad <br>it broke<br>and slacked the strain.</p>

                <summary>Gluey (for Aly)</summary>
                <p>The sun just about peaks through<br>and smiles at me, warm gaze,<br>hardening in such a way<br>that I can almost hear the beeps,<br>curing light, setting the glue that keeps<br>my current self stuck to this chair.<br>Stuck like on the saddle of my bike<br>when I fly past on a brisk cricket night. <br>Or the resin that made me close my eyes,<br>sunken and sewed in your seat,<br>freezing senses, the smell of your hair,<br>the constant flow of air, fighting the heat.</p>
                <p>I suppose I use glue, resin and rivets <br>to keep me where I want to be.<br>Like sitting in your car for six hours<br>or laying in bed with earbuds,<br>thinking about you and me,<br>while essentially,<br>I would like to run through fields with clawless paws<br>and I know the bugs will shudder their scissor jaws,<br>especially if I would sit with them or roll through<br>the tall grass near my house, glued to you.</p>
                <p>But, as I sit in the sun, a thought starts to brew;<br>I'll see you soon, in unknown places,<br>that I'll later reflect on and write.<br>So for now, I would like to linger longer<br>and stay stuck to your traces,<br>maybe for a few more hours before the glue unsticks<br>and you take flight.</p>

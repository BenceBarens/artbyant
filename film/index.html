                    <p>The W4ke0pp Documentary is a film I created about the early days of my clothing brand, W4ke0pp. Over the course of four months, I captured behind-the-scenes footage of my best friend and me designing the clothing, building the website, launching a marketing campaign, and managing all aspects of starting the brand.</p>

                    <p>Blue Moon Heist” is the first sci-fi film I ever made. I've always been fascinated by sci-fi films like Star Wars and Blade Runner, but creating one myself came with big challenges. I had almost no budget, few actors, and limited locations. Since sci-fi often demands heavy props, visual effects, and large sets, I focused on writing a story that required as little VFX as possible.</p>
                    <p>What I did have was skill in making costumes and props. With the help of my 3D printer and an old Nerf gun, I built a full sci-fi costume for the main character. The plot was simple: a mysterious figure arrives on a dark planet in search of a hidden treasure, facing monsters along the way that he narrowly escapes.</p>
                    <p>To bring this world to life, I shot in the dunes of Soest and used a day-for-night effect to transform the landscape into an eerie alien planet. With a few simple visual effects, I added a massive moon in the background and a hologram device that guided the character toward the treasure.</p>

                    <p>“Don't Die Without Jesus” is a short action sequence I filmed with martial arts and Christian influencer Giga Ovgod. We shot it in a busy bike tunnel near London. Through Giga's network, I connected with the South London stunt team, who were eager to collaborate.</p>
                    <p>I hadn't created a storyboard since I wasn't sure of the stuntmen's abilities, but on set I managed to bring my vision to life through quick direction. Together with Giga and the team, we crafted dynamic action moves that turned into an intense and exciting scene.</p>

                    <p>I was tasked with creating the music video for Samir's new single “Elke Dag”, a love song about a boy who wants to see his girlfriend every day of the week. The creative process began with scouting locations. I knew I wanted to capture the love between Samir and his girlfriend by filming their dates in different settings.</p>
                    <p>With a simple storyboard, I planned to open the video with Samir dreaming about his girlfriend, getting ready for their date, and stepping onto the tram. Within a few days we had shot everything across the locations, and editing could begin.</p>
                    <p>One of my favorite concepts was a shot of Samir wearing a projection of the album cover on his sweater. To achieve this, we used a projector at night to cast the graphic directly onto his white sweater, creating a striking and memorable visual.</p>
